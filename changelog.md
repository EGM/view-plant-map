# View-Plant-Map
## Changelog:

3/4/25 - Removed TailwindCSS styling, put all styling as vanilla CSS in single file components.

3/5/25 - Restyled map shapes to red (normal) and green (selected). Added an event and 
handler to show the proper object in the details box if it's selected.

## Todo:
### Styling:
* Responsive styling - add breakpoints so mobile screens have an easier time.

### UX:
* Responsive UX - make the map "clickable" so that outlined features are selected.
* Location Aware - add a "you are here" to the map.
